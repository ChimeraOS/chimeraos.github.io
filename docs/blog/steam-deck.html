<h3>Thoughts on Steam Deck</h3>
<p>2022-02-26</p>
</center>

<br>
<p>Here are some thoughts from the perspective of ChimeraOS after seeing the coverage of the Steam Deck and the new Gamepad UI.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Very happy to see the Steam friends/chat becoming usable with a gamepad once again! The current BPM implementation was clearly a stopgap that severely degraded the experience to the point where I had just stopped using it entirely.
</li>

<li>
It looks like the built-in BPM web browser is gone. That is a shame because it was an excellent browsing experience with a controller. I wonder if it will make a comeback eventually?
</li>

<li>
The new non-Steam app section is interesting and has potential. If this could use a plug-in system, it would mean we could potentially add Epic and GOG support directly in Steam and no longer need the Chimera web app for this. For now though, the Chimera web app will conflict with this functionality as our app takes full control of all non-Steam shortcuts.
</li>

<li>
The Quick Access Menu is similar to the Chimera web app's "Actions" functionality. If the Quick Access Menu also made use of a plug-in system to allow additional functionality, we wouldn't need the Chimera app anymore.
</li>

<li>
The integration of MangoHud in the Quick Access Menu is awesome. This means we can drop the same functionality from the Chimera web app.
</li>

<li>
I like that you can now manage disks and additional libraries. This is a feature request that comes up fairly often. We even started some initial work to implement this in the Chimera wep app, but deferred in anticipation of this feature in Steam. Hopefully it is easy to integrate into other Linux operating systems.
</li>

<li>
There was some hope that dynamic libraries also meant we can add non-Steam game shortcuts dynamically. Currently Steam's shortcuts file can only be modified by an outside program while Steam is not running. It is unclear, but given the way the dynamic library feature works, it doesn't appear to encompass non-Steam shortcuts.
</li>

<li>
I am not happy that the old style horizontal banner images are still being used in places. In order to have a clean experience, that means you have to find or create both horizontal and vertical images for any non-Steam games and it is hard enough just to find even one sometimes. I have spent way too long crafting custom images for my non-Steam game collection and now I have to do double the work.
</li>

<li>
It would be amazing if instead of adding awkward gamepad support to launchers as Valve mentioned some devs are doing, Steam allowed you to manage non-Steam accounts directly in the Steam UI, such as Origin, Ubisoft, Microsoft etc. and provide an API for developers to access the linked account information without requiring you to login to each individual game. Launchers are ugly and obtrusive without providing any value to the user and I wish they would go away.
</li>

<li>
It is still unclear what kind of tech or setup underpins SteamOS 3's update system. More information on that would be welcome.
</li>

<li>
I would love to be able to check out the new UI on my own systems without a Steam Deck (still waiting on mine!) and start exploring and working on integrating the new functionality with ChimeraOS.
</li>

<li>
The addition of multi-tasking is pretty rad although personally I doubt I will use it. This is something I have seen BPM being criticized a lot for not having.
</li>
</ol>
